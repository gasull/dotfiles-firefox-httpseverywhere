<ruleset name="403 and captchas to Archive.is">
  <!--
    Prevent annoying 403 and CloudFlare captchas when on VPN or Tor by using
    Archive.is as workaround.
    Use this only in domains you use non-interactively, meaning you don't login
    nor add new content to them such as a comment or a post.
    Add new domains by adding a new target tag below.
